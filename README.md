The not-invented-here is strong with me.

I got sick of the inflexibility of octopress, want to purge liquid from my
memory with the fire of a thousand suns, and couldn't get ruhoh to make sense.

So here it is, my website. Powered by hacktastic Ruby, and frankly only Ruby
because I wanted string manipulation a little bit friendlier than bash.

When this makes some kind of sense, I'll use it to blog about it.

So fucking meta.
