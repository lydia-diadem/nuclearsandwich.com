That is all*

Recently I've read two really excellent books. [The Developer's Code][0] by Ka
Wai Cheung, and [Code Simplicity][1] by Max Kanat-Alexander. I should start off
by saying that they were both great (and short!) reads and I'd recommend either
of them to anyone. Particularly young developers still getting their first five
years' experience__(1)__. Though I've been reading a [fair few][4] books in between
these two, something about them struck me as similar and since It's been months
since I read The Developer's Code and no review materialized, I figured I'd give
some brief words about each book now

## The Developer's Code

This book is aimed at younger developers, or even folks who haven't yet decided
to become software developers. It gives a pretty good overview of the industry
in which we work and how it's perceived. The author seems utterly enamored with
code generation and found a way to bring it up in nearly every chapter. I'm not
really a fan of it at all unless it's the runtime kind of code generation.
However, it's largely incidental to the work as a whole. Lastly, chapter 6
discusses teaching and *every single one of you must read __it__* NOW. It's not
even eight pages and yet he collects a handful of techniques it has taken me
more seven years of instructing__(2)__ to be able to put to words. The book was
worth the full price to see these words written in front of me. If you need to
borrow it, let me know. [@sgharms](http://twitter.com/sgharms) has my copy right
now.

## Code Simplicity

I will admit to buying this book as an impulse buy because the ebook was
half-off on [O'Reilly.com](http:///oreilly.com). I'm ever so glad I did though
as it's been a very easy and enjoyable read. At first I felt the method of
describing the author's observations as Laws was considerably presumptive
behavior. However, like the laws of gravity and motion in the physics world, the
precise wordings have genericity[<strong>(3)</strong>][3] and a timeless quality. One of the
stand-out aspects of this book to my mind was the complete absence of software
testing until the very last law of the book. I was impressed by this because as
I've [written before][5], testing is not itself an end, it is a means to the end
of successful, quality software that performs its duty of helping people.
Throughout the book there is discussion of evidence and verification, from which
testing should arise naturally. While I respect the author's desire to add a
specific law of software testing, I think it could be omitted as a duplicate in
a [George Carlin-esque][6] fashion.

Thanks for your eyes,

Steven!


__(1)__ I'm talking *real* experience. Not LOL I was writing C64 machine language in
the womb by tugging on the umbilical cord in binary Morse code.

__(2)__ When I was sixteen, I was reassigned from lifeguarding to teaching
photography at the boy scout camp where I was working. I had no idea at the
time, but the shake-up resulted in the discovery of two of the great passions in
my life, photography and teaching. I went on in subsequent years to teach
lifeguarding, teach teaching lifeguarding, and now teach programming and
software development to whomever I can.
