Readers, friends, lovers,

I'm both incredibly pleased and bloody terrified to announce my conference
speaking debut will be at this year's [Golden Gate Ruby Conference][gogaruco].

I will be presenting my thoughts on trying to teach object-oriented programming,
specifically the Ruby language, using a semantics-first approach.

As the conference draws closer I may be writing more on the subject here but the
magic will all happen at GoGaRuCo. So there's truly no reason not to
[register][] right now.

See you there,

Steven!
