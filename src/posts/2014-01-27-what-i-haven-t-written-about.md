In the last year, I haven't written about anything. Here's an incomplete list of
things I haven't written about between trying to finish my undergraduate degrees
and working at GitHub:

* Building new mail servers for nuclearsandwich.com that don't suck as bad
* Epic nerdy vintage computering
* Making no progress trying to expand upon [Sugar Free Ruby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNbBC2pSiVw)
* Playing lots of video games
* Reading a lot more non-fiction
* Really though, the GitHub Flow
* Running RailsBridge workshops
* Teaching with Girls Who Code and Coder Dojo
* Writing a programming course for kids

It's been a solid year and I wrote quite a bit privately but wish I'd taken the
time to distill more of that and actually publish it. I make no guarantees to
change this year, but I needed the catharsis of publishing *something*.
