Everybody I know please follow these instructions.

- Set aside 10 minutes.
- Get good speakers or good headphones.
- Set aside ten minutes to play both these videos at once.
- Open both these videos at the same time in tabs. They are both sound only.

You are listening to James Earl Jones (voice of Darth Vader) reading Edgar Allen
Poe's 'The Raven' with Claude Debussy's 'Nuages' playing in the background.
You may need to turn Vader down so the music can come out.

*This is fucking cool.*
