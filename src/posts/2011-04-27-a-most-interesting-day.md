Today was an interesting day. I helped to start an International holiday in
Corenominal Day, stopped for coffee when I was already running late despite the
fact that I loathe being tardy, tolerated and even enjoyed some aspects of
classes today, and got stung by a wasp that got trapped in my beard while I was
cycling home. All in all, today was quite eventful. Though I still didn't get as
much done as I {needed,intended,wanted}. Oh well, there's always tomorrow.
