So a while ago, I got it into my head that I wanted to learn CSS by way of
styling my own damn web zone. It was also clear that the only reason
nuclearsandwich.com had for existing was hosting my blog, and it made sense to
move that whole operation to the primary domain rather than having a [cheap
camping page][camping] page.

The C0deZ
---------

The source for this page is up on GitHub [here][source]. It isn't pretty and it
isn't meant to be. This is an organic, needs-based, project and if anyone else
ever uses it then it will be their own damn mess.

What do I like about it?

- Markdown
- Mustache!
- Minimal moving parts

What do I miss about Jekyll/Octopress?

- Having everything working
- Having someone else to blame
- Not fucking Liquid, that's for sure
- Probably lots of things I've totally forgotten about

There are plenty of things Octopress does that my shit doesn't: categories, RSS,
that whole sidebar deal. I expect I'll miss those things eventually and
implement them in some way that makes sense to me.

In the meantime, read this or don't. Tell me if I'm being stupid on [Twitter][]
