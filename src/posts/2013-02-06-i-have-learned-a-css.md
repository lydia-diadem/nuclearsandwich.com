I recently wanted to build a small project for GitHub. I've built a solid
handful of web things in the past, but my skill has always been in constructing
decent applications that are functional in the browser but not necessarily easy
to use and rarely easy on the eyes. I find it really difficult to think
critically about the design of a web page when my ideal look and feel for nearly
everything involves imagining what it would look like in a terminal emulator.

Luckily, I work with people who know better than me the fine (possibly black)
art of building compelling designs and it was my fellow GitHubber
[@cobyism][] to whom I turned when I wanted a boostie up in the CSS and design
department.

Since Coby is currently living in the UK, the price for my lesson was remaining
functional between 12:30AM and 4:30AM, which may have cost me the ability to pay
attention in class the following day.
